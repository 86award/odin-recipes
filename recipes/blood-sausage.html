        <h1>Thelsamar Blood Sausage</h1>
        <p>This particular intestine-stuffed delicacy dates back several, possibly hundreds of, generations. The people of this plate's native region found sustenance by turning the necessary culling of aggressive predators in a food production paradise. If you can get the specific ingredients that is. Boars don't always have intestines it seems...</p>

        <ul>
            <li>3 x Boar Intestines (they're pretty big sausages).</li>
            <li>3 x Bear Meat (watch out for the reding claws - the sausages are worth it, I promise).</li>
            <li>3 x Spider Ichor (probably best to cut the head off before trying to extract the sticky ichor).</li>
            <p>It seems the people of this region really value the number 3.</p>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>First, thoroughly wash out the boar intestines with clean spring water, we don't need half digested food in our bangers.</li>
            <li>Assuming you have already carved out a juicy bear steak (if not, check out this pleasent guide <a href="https://youtu.be/fr3-5Tojcgo?t=20">on animal butchery)</a> mince into a paste using a friends hammer (it's a messy job, don't damage your weapon of war).</li>
            <li>Mix the spider ichor into the now pasted bear steak.</li>
            <li>Carefull stuff the boar intestines with the meat/ichor mix, tying off every when you have the desired length.</li>
            <li>Roast over open fire and share with friends.</li>
