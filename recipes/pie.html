    <h1>Squirrel Pot Pie</h1>
    <p>As the name suggests, it's not fancy, it's a squirrel cooked in a pot, with some 'pastry'.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 x dead squirrel, preferably (it's easier that way).</li>
        <li>1 x metal container. A used can is ideal. Don't throwaway anything already in the can, it can only add to the flavour.</li>
        <li>Honestly, you're not going to be making pastry in the apocalypse so maybe an irradiated leaf will do.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the <em>dead</em> squirrel in the pot. Cover with whatever you've managed to find to act as pastry.</li>
        <li>Heat to a <strong>very hot </strong>temperature to cook the irradiated meat thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Enjoy. Yummy!</li>
    </ol>
