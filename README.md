This is a project to demonstrate the knowledge gained over the past couple of days with respect to Git and html.

I need to:
    1/ Create an index page complete with boilerplate
    2/ Title for index page is 'Odin Recipes'
    3/ Create a new dir [mkdir] called recipes
    4/ Within recipes create individual html files for the recipes
    5/ Each should have a h1 with a link back to the root index
    6/ Each recipe page should have an image of the finished dish
    7/ Each image should have a description of the dish
    8/ Provide an unordered list of ingredients under h2 heading
    9/ Ordered list to define steps to making the dish
    10/ Add two more dishes as above

Bonus:
    1/ Link to ingredients from supermarket


To make public afterwards:
    1/ go to your GitHub repo on the web.
    2/ click on the Settings button from the panel at the top.
    3/ click on Pages on the left side bar.
    4/ change the Source from none to main branch and click Save.
